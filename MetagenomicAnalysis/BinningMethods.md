# Binning tools implemented 
The output of the Megahit Co-assembly of the 18 enrichments and the single-enrichmet assemblies are the target of the binning into MAGs.

For Binning the output of MegaHit assembly, we used the tools [COMEBin](https://github.com/ziyewang/COMEBin), [SemiBin2](https://github.com/BigDataBiology/SemiBin), and [MetaDecoder](https://github.com/liu-congcong/MetaDecoder).

## COMEBIN
### Preprocessing of Assembly data
Conda environment for COMEBin was created following installation instrictions [here](https://github.com/ziyewang/COMEBin).

1. Using `COMEBin/scripts/gen_cov_file.sh` to generate coverage information. Coverage information is required as input for COMEBin (-p). The input is the assembly file, followed by the reads of all of the samples that went into the assmebly.

Single-enriched assemblies and the co-assembly of the 18 enrichments were binned independently
