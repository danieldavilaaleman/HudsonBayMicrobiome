# RKPG analysis for Canadian protein catalog

Steps:

1. Generation of the protein catalog of th eenrichment metagenome
2. Dereplication of protein catalog
3. Functional identification of proteins
4. Mapping of global reads to protein catalog
5. Calculation RPKG

## Getting a protein catalogue of a metagenome
I used Plass to assemble a catalogue of protein sequences directly from each of the 18 enrichment metagenomic reads plus a co-assembly approach (cat all R1.fastq / R2.fastq), without the nucleic assembly step. It recovers 2 to 10 times more protein sequences from complex metagenomes than other state-of-the-art methods and can assemble huge datasets
