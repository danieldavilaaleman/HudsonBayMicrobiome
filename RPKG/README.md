# RKPG analysis for Canadian protein catalog

## Getting a protein catalogue of a metagenome
I uses Plass to assemble a catalogue of protein sequences directly from the 18 enrichment metagenomic reads plus a co-assembly approach (cat all R1.fastq / R2.fastq), without the nucleic assembly step. It recovers 2 to 10 times more protein sequences from complex metagenomes than other state-of-the-art methods and can assemble huge datasets
